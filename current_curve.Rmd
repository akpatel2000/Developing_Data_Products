## Current Treasury Yield Curve
- data source Bloomberg
- curve generated by natural spline method

```{r curve, echo=FALSE}
## Calculate spline curve from current yield curve
treasuryYield1Y = 1.23
treasuryYield2Y = 1.39
treasuryYield5Y = 1.89
treasuryYield10Y = 2.34
treasuryYield30Y = 2.92

treasuryCurve <- spline(c(1,2,5,10,30), 
               c(treasuryYield1Y, treasuryYield2Y, treasuryYield5Y, 
                 treasuryYield10Y, treasuryYield30Y), 
               n=30, method = "natural")

plot(treasuryCurve, xlab = "Maturity", ylab = "Yield")
```
